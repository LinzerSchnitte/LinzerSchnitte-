Welcome to the LinzerSchnitte Project

This is a project to control large numbers of remote devices using a low cost programmable FM broadcast receiver.

Both the hardware and software for the project are being made open source by the Ars Electronica Future Lab. 

The first performance of the system was to control over 4,000 led strips, at the Klangwolke 2012 held in Linz, Austria on September 1st 2012.

The system consists of a programmable FM receiver which can decode audio control tones and RDS commands sent from a central FM transmitter,  a low power RDS FM transmitter is being planned as a parallel project. 

Hope you enjoy the project..
